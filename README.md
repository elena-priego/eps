Working on R (\>= 3.5.0)

eps is an R package with miscellaneous R functions that are useful to me.

## Useful functions to create the package

-   `devtools::document()` to generate the Rd and update NAMESPACE  
-   `devtools::build()` to generate the package  
-   `devtools::check()` to look for errors and warnings  
-   `use_data(object, eps, overwrite = TRUE)` to save an object in data. There's need to create an R file with Roxygen documentation.
-   inst folder have installed packages in my computer
